# Crazy CV 
### An anti-interactive arttech installation expoloring the machinic translation of human lives into data-points with visual flair. 
#### Built on OpenCV, and Security/Privacy concerns regarding the widespread adoption of Facial Recognition Technology

CrazyCV is an installation that explores the dark side of AI-based surveillance, traversing the gray boundaries between privacy and accessibility in a hyper-connected world. Using OpenCV's image and object detection the entire setup creates an unsettling atmosphere, suggesting that we're always being watched and reduced to mere data points in a vast, impersonal database.

As visitors enter; outlines of their bodies, clothing, and images are processed by OpenCV running on the Yolov5 implementing a creative GUI written in python. The focal point is a large 4K screen that scans visitors; with intentionally unreliable detection. It often misidentifies objects and assigns them pseudo-random values, emphasizing the inaccuracy of AI systems. Each visitor is assigned a fake identity generated through the FakeName Generator API, complete with fabricated sensitive information like name, age, and credit card numbers. This highlights the reduction of humans, and their lives into data-driven binary jargon, underscoring the absurdity of trusting AI with personal details.

The installation embodies the what-could-be-chaotic side of technology by embracing glitches,distortions, and randomization. A synthetic (digital on-screen) voice adds a dystopian touch, with phrases like "Have you taken your daily dose of electronic supplements?" and sudden outbursts that interrupt the program. The voice falters, stutters, and glitches, as if losing control. This erratic behavior amplifies the sense of disarray, and taps into a little dystopia.

### Facial Recognition Technology (FRT)
Research on FRT (Facial Recognition Technology) was performed, excerpts from unlawful U.S Government & ICE (Immigration Customs Enforcement), Recent facial & biometric data dumps from companies illegally collecting FRT data. Further research, and exposition on the ideas of “Who Trains the AI”; training of these models which are in such high demand that the MAANG companies’ processing powers cannot keep up; leaving them to resort to “hiring” workers in South East Asian countries to laboriously train their models was provided.

"CrazyCV" invites visitors to reflect on the implications of a world where technology monitors our every move. It questions the legitimacy of AI-based surveillance, highlighting the risks of placing too much trust in flawed systems. Ultimately, it serves as a stark reminder that even the most advanced technology can be manipulated, leading to a future where our identities and privacy are at constant risk of being compromised.
